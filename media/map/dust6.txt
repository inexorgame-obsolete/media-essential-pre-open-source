Dust6 was created by Rudi in May of 2014, and was handed over to me (Sheik) to finish. It was then reworked for Inexor in January 2015.

Much thanks goes to:

 Rudi for creating the original layout and design, and for trusting me to take it over for him.

 The few people who helped with Rudi in the beginning (you know who you are).

 Everyone who commented on quadropolis.us and sauerworld.org

 Lee “eihrul” Salzman and Wouter “Aardappel” van Oortmerssen for the Cube2 Engine.

 The Inexor team for including my maps :).

Enjoy playing!
