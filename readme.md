# Sauerbraten Fork Data Files


This repository contains all data files for the [Sauerbraten Fork](https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork/sauerbraten-fork) project.
It is intended as a minimal package (at a size of ~100MB ) covering only a few maps and core depencies.
A big problem in sauerbraten is copyright, which makes the game non-free. This is why we are having a strict [licensing guideline](https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork/sauerbraten-fork/issues/14).
Currently the repository is straight work in progress.

## Goals

1. ~~Create a cut down version of the sauerbraten core data files which do not conflict with the licensing~~
2. ~~Provide a minimal package including some maps, models and textures for testing~~
3. ~~Restructure the minimal package to fit [newpackaging](https://github.com/sauerbraten-fork/sauerbraten-fork/tree/newpackaging)~~
4. Create a "backward-package" of popular Sauerbraten maps (additional) to make the game more familliar.

## How can I help?
